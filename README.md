# tree-sitter-typespec

This is a grammar for [typespec](https://typespec.io/), including highlights and indents.

The [official TypeSpec grammer](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/blob/main/packages/spec/src/spec.emu.html) was used to derive this tree-sitter grammar. The grammar follows the spec closely, but omits projections as per the advice of the project maintainers.
